Retry Sausages|Tuesday, 5/13/2025 12:54|If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?|I would have eaten more sausages. I mean look at what happend to that guy in groundhog day. If I could do it over again it wouldn't matter what I did with the sausages. I could kill one of my brothers with the sausages, stuck one up my nose, or stolen all of the sausages from everyone else. Its a good thing I can't do things over.
