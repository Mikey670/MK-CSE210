Who was the most interesting person I interacted with today?
What was the best part of my day?
How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?
If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?
What has it gots in its pocketses?
How many fingers am I holding up?
What is the tastiest thing I have eaten today?
